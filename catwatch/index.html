  <h2>WELCOME</h2>
      <p>Cats are not uncommon in literature, and different writers have different attitudes towards cats. Whether in novels or
      prose, Lu Xun has always held an attitude of abhorrence and disgust towards cats. In the article "Dogs, Cats, and Rats",
      we know the reason why <a href="https://www.baidu.com/s?ie=utf-8&f=3&rsv_bp=1&rsv_idx=1&tn=49055317_30_hao_pg&wd=%E9%B2%81%E8%BF%85&fenlei=256&oq=%25E9%25B2%2581%25E8%25BF%2585%2520%25E7%258C%25AB&rsv_pq=d52a335a00000ee3&rsv_t=5bcbXDWQDRfc7b4W0ULaPF%2BxJRE%2Feckf13JDZ%2FFA0HWRolqgZpvQ5C5lGG8XXvYqYMBb4eAB7Kef&rqlang=cn&rsv_enter=1&rsv_dl=ts_0&rsv_btype=t&inputT=2429&rsv_sug3=15&rsv_sug1=14&rsv_sug7=100&rsv_sug2=1&prefixsug=%25E9%25B2%2581%25E8%25BF%2585&rsp=0&rsv_sug4=2962&rsv_sug=1" target="_blank"><strong>Lu Xun</strong></a>hated cats and beat cats through the memories of his childhood experiences. It turns out
      that cats ate his beloved pet hidden mouse. Cats are powerful, greedy, and bullying images. In "Cat and Rabbit", it is
      written that the two children of a pair of white rabbits were eaten by a "hateful" "big cat", "the hateful thing is a
      big cat , often looking viciously at the low wall... ". The hatred for cats expresses Lu Xun's sympathy and love for
      life and the weak, and his hatred for the brutal and cruel. However, the cats in the novels and essays of Taiwanese
      contemporary writer Zhu Tianxin do not have the slightest meaning of cruelty. In works such as "Hunters" and "Song of
      the Land", whether they are domesticated or strays, they are all docile, understanding, and clever. </p>
      <p> The characteristics of strong independence in life. The novel "I Am a Cat" written by the famous Japanese writer Natsume
      Soseki is a masterpiece of venting hatred through cats. The "cat" is a fictitious artistic image, which has both animal
      habits and human ideology. With the cat's insight, he pointed out: "I now understand that the movement of everything in
      the world is indeed money. Those who can fully understand the function of money and can flexibly use the power of money,
      except capitalists and lords , there are no other characters." Thus expressing the author's deep aversion to capitalists
      and the power of money. It can be said that cats in the literary world are<em> "cats are cats, and cats are not cats"</em>.</p>
